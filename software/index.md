You can find my Github page [here](https://github.com/Speldosa). What follows is a selection of some software that I've written.

* [**rehersify**](https://github.com/Speldosa/rehersify) - A small [Python](https://www.python.org/) script that uses [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) to create rehersal music files out of individual music files containing single voices.
* [**csvFTW**](https://github.com/Speldosa/csvFTW) - A small [Python](https://www.python.org/) script that modifies csv files for you in accordance with certain criterias.
