#### About me
My name is Martin Asperholm. I'm a cognitive scientist interested in science, philosophy, design and the intersection between the three afformentioned fields. I also like to be creative.

Currently, I'm a PhD student at [The Division of Psychology](http://ki.se/en/cns/the-division-of-psychology) (where I'm also the Webmaster) at [Karolinska Institutet](http://ki.se/en/startpage) in Stockholm. I also sing in [Stockholm's University Choir](http://www.stockholmsuniversitetskor.se). My CV can be downloaded [here](./Martin Asperholm CV.pdf).

#### About this site
This site is my repository on the internet. It's where I will post and organize all the content that I've created and that I think is worth sharing. This site is still under construction, so expect it to change from time to time.

This site is hosted at <img src="/images/GithubLogo.svg" class=icon> [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), which runs <img src="/images/JekyllIcon.svg" class=iconJekyll> [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the deus ex machina of the web. To hear more about it, listen to [this episode of The Web Ahead](http://5by5.tv/webahead/54)</a>. If you want to host your own site on Github, I can warmly recommend [Tomas Bradley YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWjCJDeWfDdfVEcLGAfdJn_HXyM4Y7_k-) on the matter.
